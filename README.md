Various tools, including: 
* dicts.merge() - functional deep dictionary merge
* dicts.merge_new() - same as above, but returns copy (less efficient but safer)
* dicts.dig() - deep dictionary "get" with dot notation retrieval
* dicts.Obj() - dictionary in object form that is robust. Not python zen because it provides an alternate way to use dictionaries.  But I'm okay with this, becuase it is handy.
